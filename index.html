    What makes the skin so special?
    Skin: Layers, Structure and Function
    The skin is the body's largest organ, made of water, protein, fats and minerals. Your skin protects your body from
    germs and regulates body temperature. Nerves in the skin help you feel sensations like hot and cold.
    What makes the skin special?
    In fact, each inch of skin is made up of 19 million skin cells, 650 sweat glands, 20 blood vessels, and 1,000 nerve endings,
    according to the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD). “The skin is the body's largest organ.
    It's our first line of defense against the outside world, including irritants and allergens. What is the most important thing about skin?
    One of the most important ways to take care of your skin is to protect it from the sun. A lifetime of sun exposure can cause wrinkles, 
    age spots and other skin problems — as well as increase the risk of skin cancer.

    <b>Here are some of the tips to having a glowing skin</b>

    <h2>Tips to having a glowing skin</h2></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Follow the rules of CTM (Cleansing, Toning, Moisturizing)</li>
        A proper skincare routine is the best way to encourage clear, luminant skin. A simple routine that takes just few
        minutes each day is enough to see a significant improvement. Cleansing, toning and moisturizing—in that order—get rid 
        of makeup, dirt, dead skin cells, oil, and other pollutants that build up on our skin throughout the day.
        CTM also rebalances the pH levels of your skin and rehydrates your cells, leaving your skin feeling soft and supple.
        <li>From fluids to food</li>
        Looking good on the outside starts with taking care of the inside. It may sound straightforward, but you can’t 
        underestimate the impact diet has on your skin. If you eat processed foods and drink alcohol, it takes a toll on 
        your skin and your complexion will reflect that lifestyle. The best solution is to maintain a balanced diet that 
        consists of lots of fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains and nuts, and drinking half around two liters of water every day.
        <li>Exfoliate three or two times a week</li>
        Exfoliation is the removal of surface dry skin cells. While over-exfoliating (every day) can lead to skin irritation, dryness
        and accelerated signs of aging, exfoliating two to three times per week (or just once if your skin is sensitive) can help keep 
        pores from becoming clogged and leave the skin feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. It can also improve the overall strength and 
        health of your skin, even out the tone and clarity, stimulate collagen production and revive the appearance of dull skin.
        <li> Wash your face regularly with a gentle facial cleanser</li>
        Washing your face is the first step to getting a glowing complexion. Washing twice a day with a gentle cleanser will help remove
         impurities and free radicals from the skin, helping dull skin look vibrant.
         <li>Use a vitamin C serum for brighter skin</li>
         As skin ages, collagen production dwindles, causing the skin to lose its elasticity. Vitamin C topicals help brighten your skin 
         tone and a combination of topical and oral Vitamin C can help boost collagen production, potentially helping minimize wrinkles 
         and fine lines. People with especially dry skin can benefit from layering a serum with a moisturizer.
        <li>Massage your face daily</li>
        A daily massage improves facial muscle tone, enhances product absorption and improves blood circulation, all of which can help 
        increase your skin’s glow. So next time you’re winding down at the end of a long day, grab some lovely oil— argan or jojoba are
        good options—and give your face a well-deserved massage.
        <li>Treat yourself to facials</li>
        A facial provides nutrients to the skin, working to repair any damage, and perking up the overall tone and appearance of the face. 
        It also clears your pores, allowing your skin to breathe. If you’re prone to conditions like acne, psoriasis, melasma or wrinkles, 
        visit the Siriroj Cosmetic Skin Center in Phuket to discuss treatment options.
        <li>Get enough sleep</li>
        It’s called “beauty sleep” for a reason, and without enough of it, you can exacerbate existing skin conditions and accelerate the 
        aging process. Between 7-9 hours of restful, regenerative sleep each night contribute to better health and beautiful skin. 
        Focussing on your health and wellness is a beautiful thing, and when you take care of yourself, it shows.
        <li>Try a hydrating face mask. </li>
        Make face masks part of your regular skincare routine. They're great products for improving skin texture and can deliver a hefty
         dose of hydration.
         <li>Protect your skin with a daily sunscreen</li>
         UV rays can cause sun damage, leading to blemishes such as dark spots. Apply a daily, broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher. 
         If you do experience sunburn, soothe and hydrate your skin with aloe vera.
